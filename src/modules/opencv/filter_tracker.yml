notes: >
  If used in a non-linear workflow, this filter works best with two passes.
  The first pass performs analysis and stores the result in a property.
  The second pass applies the results to the image.

  To use with melt, use 'melt ... -consumer xml:output.mlt all=1' for the
  first pass. For the second pass, use output.mlt as the input.
